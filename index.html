					<p> 
						Hi I am Leann and this is my first time coding :) I am passionnate about art, sports and learning. That is why I'm so excited to learn how to code : I have always been interested to know how to do it, how websites really works and how to create one.

				<h2>Art</h2>
					<p>
					I love art. I have been doing some since I can hold a pencil. I love every aspect of it: music, sculpture, drawing, photography, film, litterature... I do and love each one of them
					</p>

				<h2>Sports</h2>
					<p>
					I love sports. I find every single one attractive because I did a lot of different sports when I was young: tennis, baseball, handball, football, vollayball, gymnastics, horse-riding... I wasn't the greatest in each but I loved playing them.
					</p>

				<h2>Learning</h2>
					<p>
					I love learning. This could sound weird, but the process of learning new things every day makes me enjoy a lot more school. As sports, I am not the greatest in every course, but I try my best to do the maximum I can do in each.
